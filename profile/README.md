## Our story

Lekko was started as a **dynamic configuration** platform startup inspired by tools that have been built and heavily used in organizations like Uber and Meta, but are not available for a general audience.

Throughout a 2-year journey, we've developed unique features, workflows, and technologies that enable dynamic configuration with a lot of product experimentation and learnings gained along the way.


At the end of 2024, we, the founding team, were acquired by another company and so we've decided to open source the core technology behind Lekko as a platform. We plan on continuing to maintain and improve Lekko to make it more easily available and self-hostable in our free time because we still believe in the vision behind its inception and the lack of satisfactory tools in the market.
